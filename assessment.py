Part 1: Discussion

1. What are the three main design advantages that object orientation
   can provide? Explain each concept.
   -Smarter dictionaries: keeps data closer together and keeps track of the functions
   that relate to a data structure. Keeps cleaner and more efficient code. 
   -Flexible structure: enables a program to reuse the same functions with variation
   in a more efficient way. 
   -Hierarchies: object orientation can provide a hierchy of instances that are inherited
   from one class to another. 

2. What is a class?
Classes are a core part of object-oriented programming. A class is like a mini 
program within a program that holds it's own set of instructions. 
A blueprint for the program. 

3. What is an instance attribute?
The process of instantiation. It can ask in an instance what class it is. 

4. What is a method?
A method is like a function defined on a class. 

5. What is an instance in object orientation?
An individual occurance of a class. 

6. How is a class attribute different than an instance attribute?
   Give an example of when you might use each.
   A class is a type "type of thing." It is a bigger puzzle piece in code. An 
   instance is an individual occurance. It is one circumstance in a code.
